I"®<p>The Weasleys Clock was a magical clock from the Harry Potter books owned by the Weasley family which individually monitored each of their whereabouts. The clock had nine golden hands, one for every member of the household. In place of hours on the clockâ€™s face were a series of possible locations indicating the family member currently stays. My clock only has 2 hands because I simply reused the mechanics of the clock.</p>
